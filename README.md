# Gemini
A single page serverless, lightweight, responsive, website to call Google's AI language and vision model.

## Report
- Goto wiki tab [Gemini - Screenshots](https://github.com/ab007shetty/Gemini/files/14318860/Gemini.-.Report.pdf)  to see Test Results.

## Note
- I would advise against hosting this webpage with the apiKey hardcoded as it may pose a risk of being leaked on the internet and Google will disable the apiKey.
- Additionally, please refrain from using the apiKey provided in the about section, as it is intended only for new users to test quickly.
